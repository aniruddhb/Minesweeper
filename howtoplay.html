				Overview</h3>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				Minesweeper is an age-old and extremely captivating game. The game consists of a grid, or minefield, which contains multiple cells. The objective of the game is to clear the grid of all its mines without clicking on a mine itself. Once a user flags all of the mines, the game is over, and a time is reported. Compete with yourself, or compete with your friends; Minesweeper provides for all-around fun.</p>

				Cells</h3>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				There are 6 unique types of cells in the game of Minesweeper: mines, numbers, and blank spaces. This section will describe each type of cell, and what happens if you click them.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img alt="pictureofcell.png" src="pictureofcell.PNG" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cell that looks like this is an untouched cell. At the beginning of each Minesweeper game, all cells are in this state.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img alt="pictureof1.png" src="pictureof1.PNG" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cell that has a number on it means that that cell has been opened. The number displayed represents the exact number of mines that the cell is touching. In this case, this certain cell would be touching one and ONLY one mine.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img src="pictureofmine.PNG" alt="pictureofmine.png" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cell that displays a mine on it means that you have clicked a mine, and the game is now over. The mine that you clicked to end the game will be displayed on a red background, while all other mines on the board will be displayed on a gray background.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img alt="pictureofflag.png" src="pictureofflag.PNG" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; A cell that displays a flag means that you have currently flagged that cell, in suspicion that the cell is actually a mine in disguise.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img alt="pictureofquestion.png" src="pictureofquestion.PNG" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp;A cell that displays a question mark means that you have currently &quot;questioned&quot; the cell, meaning that you are not 100% sure that the cell is a mine, but have flagged it to avoid any clicking mistakes.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<img alt="pictureofempty.png" src="pictureofempty.PNG" style="width: 47px; height: 48px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; A cell that displays an empty gray color signifies that the cell in question is an empty cell, and contains neither a number nor a mine. These cells are referred to as &quot;spacers&quot;.</p>

				How to Win (Not really)</h3>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				There are many ways to play and win the game of Minesweeper. However, all approaches require logical thinking and reasoning. One must use reasoning and sometimes guessing in order to ascertain the position of mines of the field. One approach to solving the board is detailed as followed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li style="text-align: left;">
					Click around the board 3 or 4 times in order to create a clearing for yourself (this is where luck comes in, as some lucky clicks will clear most of the board for you - this is also how people achieve world records in Minesweeper)</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">
					Mark off any outstanding corners of the board where mines must be located - this will help you clear the lower value pieces (1&#39;s, 2&#39;s, etc)</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">
					Work your way inwards, using logic and the fact that the number drawn on each cell dictates the EXACT amount of mines that the cell touches; there can no more and no less touching that piece.</li>
			</ol>
